# MovieRental Exercise

This is a dummy representation of a movie rental system.
Can you help us fix some issues and implement missing features?

 * The app is throwing an error when we start, please help us. Also, tell us what caused the issue. Done in: https://github.com/sergiofffilho/MovieRental/commit/7bc27113f85ff55caadfbd0b02846e6b2066e6be
 * The rental class has a method to save, but it is not async, can you make it async and explain to us what is the difference? Done in: https://github.com/sergiofffilho/MovieRental/commit/7bc27113f85ff55caadfbd0b02846e6b2066e6be
 * Please finish the method to filter rentals by customer name, and add the new endpoint. Done in: https://github.com/sergiofffilho/MovieRental/commit/4655ba5cddca4739e540d9fd6bbfcb43db00af3e
 * We noticed we do not have a table for customers, it is not good to have just the customer name in the rental.
   Can you help us add a new entity for this? Don't forget to change the customer name field to a foreign key, and fix your previous method! Done in: https://github.com/sergiofffilho/MovieRental/commit/b7acc18e23e27a900acd8579153d8ed55fae21eb
 * In the MovieFeatures class, there is a method to list all movies, tell us your opinion about it.
 * No exceptions are being caught in this api, how would you deal with these exceptions?
