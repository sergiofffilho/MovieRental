# MovieRental Exercise

This is a dummy representation of a movie rental system.
Can you help us fix some issues and implement missing features?

 * The app is throwing an error when we start, please help us. Also, tell us what caused the issue.
 * The rental class has a method to save, but it is not async, can you make it async and explain to us what is the difference?
 * Please finish the method to filter rentals by customer name, and add the new endpoint.
 * We noticed we do not have a table for customers, it is not good to have just the customer name in the rental.
   Can you help us add a new entity for this? Don't forget to change the customer name field to a foreign key, and fix your previous method!
 * In the MovieFeatures class, there is a method to list all movies, tell us your opinion about it.
 * No exceptions are being caught in this api, how would you deal with these exceptions?
